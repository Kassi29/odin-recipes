# Odin Recipes

This project is a simple website that displays cooking recipes. It includes popular recipes such as **Pancakes** and **Turkey**, along with images and a basic HTML structure. This project focuses on improving my skills with HTML and CSS, as well as organizing image files within a web project.

## Project Structure

- **HTML Pages**: Each recipe has its own HTML page with the basic structure of a webpage, including the recipe name, ingredients, and preparation instructions.

  - `pancakes.html`: Contains the recipe for Pancakes.
  - `turkey.html`: Contains the recipe for Turkey.
  - `lasagna.html`: Contains the recipe for Lasagna.

- **Images Folder**: A folder `/images` has been created to organize the recipe images, such as `lasagna.webp` and images for pancakes and turkey.
